Description: Using propr and ALDEx2 functions, filtR removes OTUs generated by PCR and sequencing error from count tables. There are two filtering parameters. One is rho, which is a measure of beta-associate between two OTUs. Each individual OTU, for the most part, should lack association with other OTUs because they are independent entities. The other filtering parameter is difference in centered log ratio. If an OTU is derived from an error in PCR or sequencing, it is expected to have a much lower abundance than the OTU it associates with. The input for this package is a count table (which can contain taxonomy information in any column, but is not a requirement) and the output is a count table with the error-derived OTUs removed.
